{\en Air pollution affects our day to day activities and quality of life. It poses a threat to the ecosystem and the quality of life on the planet. The dire need to monitor air quality is very glaring, owing to increased industrial activities over the past years. People need to know the extent to which their activities affect air quality. This project proposes an air pollution monitoring system. The system is developed using the Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino UNO micro-controller. The air pollution monitoring system is designed to monitor and analyze air quality in real-time and log data to a remote server, keeping the data updated over the internet. Air quality measurements are taken based on the Parts per Million (PPM) metrics and analyzed using Flutter application. The air quality measurements taken by the designed system is accurate.The result is displayed on the designed Flutter application (which runs both on Android and iOS) and the prediction of next few days weather forecast based on past data using supervised Machine Learning approach.
